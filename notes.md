# Notes

## Potential changes
- replace `Teen/Adult` property with `DoB`

## Future Ideas
- a `Smart Tag System` 
  - A model that would establish a weight system between `tags`, representing to similarity between `tags`. Clusters of similar `tags` would form, based on how much people enjoyed past `Jobs`.
  - recommend new `Jobs` according your preferences
  - auto-regulate

##  Problems
- adding new `tags`
  - user based
  - admin based
